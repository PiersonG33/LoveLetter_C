# LoveLetter_C
A TCP connection-based version of the tabletop card game Love Letter. 
This will be written entierly in C, and likely consist of 3 files: A main file, a user file, and a server file.
This is just a personal project for fun, and not for any sort of assignment. I just like the card game.
